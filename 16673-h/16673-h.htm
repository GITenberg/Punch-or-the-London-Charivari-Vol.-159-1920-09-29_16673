<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>An epidemic of measles is reported in the North. It seems that in
  these days of strikes people are either coming out in sympathy or in
  spots.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The secret of industrial peace, says a sporting paper, is more
  entertainment for the masses. We have often wondered what our workers do
  to while away the time between strikes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The cost of living for working-class families," says Mr. C.A. <font
  class="sc">McCurdy</font>, the Food Controller, "will probably increase
  by 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week at Christmas." That is, of course, if
  Christmas ever comes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that Dean <font class="sc">Inge</font> has been invited
  to meet the <font class="sc">Food Controller</font>, in order to defend
  his title.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Nobody wants a strike," says Mr. <font class="sc">Brace</font>, M.P.
  We can only suppose therefore that they must be doing it for the
  films.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An American artist who wanted to paint a storm at sea is reported to
  have been lashed to a mast for four hours. We understand that he
  eventually broke away and did it after all.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"What is England's finance coming to?" asks a City editor in a
  contemporary. We can only say it isn't coming to us.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In Petrograd the fare for half-an-hour's cab ride is equal to two
  hundred pounds in English money at the old rate of exchange. Fortunately
  in London one could spend the best part of a day in a taxi-cab for that
  amount.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Before washing a flannel suit," says a home journal, "shake it and
  beat it severely with a stick." Before doing this, however, it would be
  just as well to make sure that the whole of the husband has been
  removed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A lion-tamer advertises in a contemporary for a situation. It is
  reported that Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> contemplates engaging
  him for Sir <font class="sc">Robert Horne</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Whatever else happens, somebody says, the public must hang together.
  But what does he think we do in a Tube?</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Primroses have been gathered at Welwyn," says <i>The Evening
  News</i>. As even this seems to have failed we think it is time to drop
  these attempts to draw the <font class="sc">Poet Laureate</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Glasgow licensees are being accused of giving short whisky measure. It
  is even said that in some extreme cases they paint the whisky on the
  glass with a camel-hair brush.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mice, says Mrs. <font class="sc">Greive</font>, of Whins, hate the
  smell of mint. So do lambs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Coal strike or no coal strike," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>, "the
  Commercial Motor Exhibition at Olympia will not be postponed." This is
  the dogged spirit that made England what it used to be.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Orpheus of old, an American journal reminds us, could move stones with
  his music. We have heard piano-players who could move whole families; but
  this was before the house shortage.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The National Association of Dancing Masters has decided to forbid "the
  cockroach dive" this year. Our advice to the public in view of this
  decision is to go about just as if nothing serious had happened.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A large party of American University students are on a visit to
  Switzerland. It is satisfactory to know that the Alps are counted every
  morning and all Americans searched before they leave the country.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The English house would make an ideal home," says an American
  journal. Possibly, if people only had one.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Three statues have been stolen in one week from Berlin streets. It is
  now suggested that the London police might be taken off duty for one
  night in order to give the thief a sporting chance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is not true, says an official report, that Scottish troops are
  being sent to Ireland. We are pleased to note this indication that the
  bagpipes should only be used in cases of great emergency.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"What does the Mexican President stand for?" asks <i>The New York
  Globe</i>. Probably because the Presidential chair is so thorny.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Dublin County authorities have decided to release from their
  asylums all but the most dangerous lunatics. We are assured that local
  conditions in no way justify this discrimination.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A jury of children has been empanelled in Paris to decide which of the
  toys exhibited at the Concours Lupine is the most amusing. We understand
  that at the time of going to press an indestructible rubber uncle is
  leading by several votes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A burglar arrested in Berlin was taken ill, and while operating upon
  him the surgeons found in his stomach six silver spoons, some forks, a
  number of screws and a silver nail file. Medical opinion inclines to the
  theory that his illness was due to something he had swallowed.</p>

<h2>BRIDGE CONVENTIONS.</h2>

  <p>The game of Auction Bridge may be divided into three species. There is
  the one we play at home, the second which we play at the Robinsons', and
  the third that is played at the high table at my club.</p>

  <p>The three games are peculiarly distinct, but I have only recently
  discovered, at some expense, that each one has its particular
  conventions. At home, if I venture a light no-trump, and Joan, sitting on
  my right, exclaims well out of turn, "Oh! father," we all know that Joan
  has the no-trumper, and the play proceeds accordingly.</p>

  <p>At the Robinsons' it is different. Suppose I make a call of one spade
  and the elder hand two hearts, and my partner (let us suppose he is
  Robinson) passes, and I say "Two spades," and the elder hand says "Three
  hearts," and Robinson bellows "No," I at once realise that it would be
  extremely dangerous to call three spades.</p>

  <p>These two typical forms of convention are quite clear and seldom lead
  to any misunderstanding. But the high table at the club is different,
  and, if I might say so with all diffidence, the conventions there are not
  so well defined. In fact they may lead to terrible confusion. I speak
  with confidence on this point because I tried them a few days ago.</p>

  <p>Three disconsolate monomaniacs wanted making up, and I, dwelling upon
  the strong game I had recently been playing at home, threw precaution to
  the winds and made them up. My partner was a stern man with a hard blue
  eye and susceptible colouring. After we had cut he informed me that,
  should he declare one no-trump, he wished to be taken out into a major
  suit of five; also, should he double one no-trump, he required me to
  declare without fail my best suit. He was going to tell me some more but
  somebody interrupted him. Then we started what appeared to be a very
  ordinary rubber.</p>

  <p>My partner perhaps was not quite at his best when it was my turn to
  lead; at least he never seemed particularly enthusiastic about anything I
  did lead, but otherwise&mdash;well, I might almost have been at the
  Robinsons'. Then suddenly he doubled one no-trump.</p>

  <p>I searched feverishly for my best suit. I had two&mdash;four diamonds
  to the eight; four hearts to the eight. A small drop of perspiration
  gathered upon my brow. Then I saw that, whereas I held the two, three,
  five of hearts, I had the two, three, six of diamonds. Breathing a small
  prayer, I called two diamonds. This was immediately doubled by the
  original declarer of no-trumps. My partner said "No," my other opponent
  said "No," and I, thinking it couldn't be worse, switched into my other
  best suit and made it two hearts. The doubler passed and I felt the glow
  of pride which comes to the successful strategist. This was frozen
  instantly by my partner's declaration of two no-trumps.</p>

  <p>If Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> were suddenly transformed into
  a Duke I am certain he would not look so genuinely horror-struck as my
  partner did when I laid my hand upon the table. Yet, as I pointed out, it
  was his own beastly convention, so I just washed my hands of it and
  leaned back and watched him hurl forth his cards as Zeus hurled the
  thunder-bolts about.</p>

  <p>Then, of course, the other convention had to have its innings. My
  partner went one no-trump, and I began to look up my five suit. In the
  meantime the next player on the declaring list doubled the no-trump. This
  was very confusing. Was he playing my partner's convention and asking
  <i>his</i> partner for his best suit? I hesitated; but orders are orders,
  so, having five spades to the nine, I declared two spades. My left-hand
  enemy said "No"; my partner said "No"; and the doubler&mdash;well, he
  doubled again. This time my partner, being Dummy, hurled down all his
  thunder-bolts&mdash;thirteen small ones&mdash;at once. When it was all
  over he explained at some length that he did not wish ever to be taken
  out of an opponent's double. I expect this was another convention he was
  going to tell me about when he was interrupted in the overture to the
  rubber. Anyway he hadn't told me, and I at some slight cost&mdash;five
  hundred&mdash;had nobly carried out his programme.</p>

  <p>When eventually the final blow fell and we, with the aid of the club
  secretary, were trying to add up the various columns of figures, the
  waiter brought up the evening papers. I seized one and, looking at the
  chief events of the day, remarked, "<font class="sc">Stevenson</font> is
  playing a great game." My late partner said, "Ah, you're interested in
  billiards." I admitted the soft impeachment. "Yes," he said dreamily, "a
  fine game, billiards; you never have to play against three
  opponents."</p>

  <p>I have now definitely decided that playing my 2 handicap game at the
  Robinsons' and my plus 1 in the home circle is all the bridge I really
  care about.</p>

<h2>SEPTEMBER IN MY GARDEN.</h2>

  <p>There are few things I find so sorrowful as to sit and smoke and
  reflect on the splendid deeds that one might have been doing if one had
  only had the chance. The <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> feels
  like this, I suppose, when he remembers how unkind people have prevented
  him from making a land fit for heroes to live in, and I feel it about my
  garden. There can be no doubt that my garden is not fit for heroes to
  saunter in; the only thing it is fit for is to throw used matches about
  in; and there is indeed a certain advantage in this. Some people's
  gardens are so tidy that you have to stick all your used matches very
  carefully into the mould, with the result that next year there is a
  shrubbery of Norwegian pine.</p>

  <p>The untidiness of my garden is due to the fault of the previous
  tenants. Nevertheless one can clearly discern through the litter of
  packing-cases which completely surrounds the house that there was
  originally a garden there.</p>

  <p>I thought something ought to be <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> done about this, so I
  bought a little book on gardening, and, turning to September, began to
  read.</p>

  <p>"September," said the man, "marks the passing of summer and the advent
  of autumn, the time of ripening ruddy-faced fruits and the reign of a
  rich and gloriously-coloured flora."</p>

  <p>About the first part of this statement I have no observation to make.
  It is probably propaganda, subsidised by the Meteorological Office in
  order to persuade us that we still have a summer; it has nothing to do
  with my present theme. But with regard to the ripening ruddy-faced fruits
  I should like to point out that in my garden there are none of these
  things, because the previous tenants took them all away when they left.
  Not a ruddy-faced fruit remains. As for the rich and gloriously-coloured
  flora, I lifted the edges of all the packing-cases in turn and looked for
  it, but it was not there either. It should have consisted, I gather, of
  "gorgeously-coloured dahlias, gay sunflowers, Michaelmas daisies,
  gladioli and other autumn blossoms, adding brightness and gaiety to our
  flower-garden."</p>

  <p>"Gaiety" seems to be rather a strong point with this author, for a
  little further on he says, "The garden should be gay throughout the month
  with the following plants," and then follows a list of about a hundred
  names which sound like complicated diseases of the internal organs. I
  cannot mention them all, but it seems that my garden should be gay
  throughout with <i>Lysimachia clethroides, Kniphofia nobilis</i> and
  <i>Pyrethrum uliginosum</i>. It is not. How anything can be gay with
  <i>Pyrethrum uliginosum</i> I cannot imagine. An attitude of reverent
  sympathy is what I should have expected the garden to have. But that is
  what the man says.</p>

  <p>Then there is the greenhouse. "From now onwards," he writes, "the
  greenhouse will meet with a more welcome appreciation than it has during
  the summer months. The chief plants in flower will be <i>Lantanas</i>,
  <i>Campanula pyramidalis</i>, <i>Zonal Pelargoniums</i>," and about
  twenty more. "Oh, they will, will they?" I thought, and opened the
  greenhouse door and looked in. Against the wall there were two or three
  mouldering peach-trees, and all over the roof and floor a riot of green
  tomatoes, a fruit which even when it becomes ruddy-faced I do not
  particularly like. In a single large pot stood a dissipated cactus,
  resembling a hedgehog suffering from mange.</p>

  <p>But what was even more bitter to me than all this ruin and desolation
  was the thought of the glorious deeds I might have been doing if the
  garden had been all right. Phrases from the book kept flashing to my
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Thoroughly scrub the base and sides of the pots, and see that the
  drainage-holes are not sealed with soil." How it thrilled the blood!</p>

  <p>"Damp the floors and staging every morning and afternoon, and see that
  the compost is kept uniformly moist." What a fascinating pursuit!</p>

  <p>"Feed the plants once a week with liquid manure." It went like a
  clarion call to the heart.</p>

  <p>And here I was condemned to <i>ennui</i> and indolence when I might
  have been sitting up all night dosing the <i>Zonal Pelargoniums</i> with
  hot beef-tea and taking the temperature of the <i>Campanula
  pyramidalis</i>. Even with the ruddy-faced fruits there would have been
  plenty to do.</p>

  <p>"Wooden trays with open lath bottoms made to slide into a framework
  afford the best means of storing apples and pears. The ripening of pears
  may be accelerated by enclosing them in bran or dry clean sand in a
  closed tin box." It did not say how often one was to clean out the cage,
  nor whether you put groundsel between the bars.</p>

  <p>I told the man next door of my sorrows.</p>

  <p>"Well, there 's plenty to do," he said. "Get a spade and dig the
  garden all over."</p>

  <p>Dig it all over indeed when I ought to be plucking nosegays of
  <i>Lysimachia clethroides</i> and <i>Pyrethrum uliginosum</i> to put in
  my buttonhole! I prefer to dream my dreams.</p>

<h2>THE CABMAN AND THE COIN.</h2>

  <p>"We must wait a minute or two for Sir Charles," said our hostess.
  "Everyone else is here," and she beamed around the room.</p>

  <p>The various <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i> dialogues that this speech
  had interrupted were resumed, most of them switching on to the question
  of punctuality. And then a cab was heard to stop outside and after a
  minute or so, presumably spent in financial transactions, the bell rang
  and the knocker knocked.</p>

  <p>"That's Sir Charles," said our hostess; "there he is;" and a few
  moments later the guest we all awaited so fervently was in the room, full
  of apologies.</p>

  <p>"Never mind why you're late," said our hostess, "I'm sure you couldn't
  help it. Now we'll eat," and once again a dozen Londoners fell into
  ark-approaching formation and moved towards repletion.</p>

  <p>The party was familiar enough, after certain solvents of speech had
  been applied, for conversation to become general; and during the
  <i>entrée</i> we were all listening to Sir Charles telling the famous
  story of the eminent numismatist who, visiting the British Museum, was
  taken for a thief. By way of making the narration the more vivid he felt
  in his pocket for a coin with which to illustrate the dramatic crisis,
  when his expression became suddenly alarmed and fixed.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" he said, fumbling nervously all over his clothes,
  "I've given it to the cabman. Of all the infernal idiocy! I knew I
  should. I had a presentiment that I should get it muddled up with my
  other money and give it away."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" he was asked.</p>

  <p>"Was it something very valuable?"</p>

  <p>"Was it a rare coin?"</p>

  <p>Murmurs of sympathy made a low accompaniment.</p>

  <p>"It was a goldmohur," said Sir Charles. "A very beautiful coin of the
  Moguls. I keep it as a kind of mascot. I've had it for years, but left it
  behind and it reached me from India only this morning. Having come away
  without it I sent a cable for it to be forwarded on. And now! It's the
  rottenest luck."</p>

  <p>"What was it worth?" our hostess asked.</p>

  <p>"Not very much. Thirty pounds perhaps. But that isn't it. The money is
  nothing&mdash;it's the sentimental associations that make the loss so
  serious."</p>

  <p>"Well," said a practical man, "you needn't despair. Ring up Scotland
  Yard and ask them the best thing to do."</p>

  <p>"Did you take the cabman's number?" some one asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course he didn't," our hostess replied. "Who ever does a thing
  like that?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said Sir Charles, "I sometimes do. But this
  time, of course, I didn't." He groaned. "No, it's gone for ever. The
  cabman will see it's gold and sell it. I wouldn't trust your modern
  taxi-chauffeur with anything."</p>

  <p>"If you would feel any happier," said our hostess, "do telephone
  now."</p>

  <p>"No," said Sir Charles, "no. It's no use. A coin like that would never
  be surrendered. It's too interesting; even a cabman would realise that.
  Umbrellas they'll take back, of course&mdash;umbrellas and bags, but not
  a goldmohur. He'll either keep it to show his pals in public-houses or
  have it fixed up as a brooch for his wife."</p>

  <p>As Sir Charles finished speaking and once more turned gloomily to his
  neglected plate the knocker was heard again to knock, and then one of the
  maids approached her mistress and spoke to her in low tones.</p>

  <p>Our hostess brightened. "Now, Sir Charles," she said, "perhaps you'll
  revise your opinion of our taxi-drivers. Tell Sir Charles what it is,"
  she said to the maid.</p>

  <p>"If you please," the maid began, "there's a cabman at the door. He
  says he brought a gentleman here and&mdash;&mdash;" Here she
  faltered.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Robins," said her mistress.</p>

  <p>"If you please, I don't like to," said the girl. "It's
  so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear it exactly," said Sir Charles.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the maid with a burst of courage, "he says there's a
  gentleman here who&mdash;who bilked him&mdash;who passed a piece of bad
  money on him in the dark. Here it is," and she handed Sir Charles the
  goldmohur. "And he says if he doesn't get an honest shilling in exchange
  for it he'll have the law on him."</p>

<h2>THE KNELL OF THE NAVY.</h2>

  <p>Spooner is a remarkable fellow. His duties on board this ship are to
  fly once a week off the deck, revolve twice round the masts and sink
  thankfully down into the water, where we haul him out by the breeches and
  hang his machine up to dry on the fo'c's'le. By performing these duties
  four times a month, he leads us to believe he is preparing the way for
  the ultimate domination of Air Power. We of the Navy are obsolete, and
  our hulls are encrusted with the Harwich barnacle.</p>

  <p>The argument proceeds on these lines: One day there will be another
  war&mdash;perhaps to-morrow. We of the Navy, coalless and probably by
  that time rumless as well, will rush blindly from our harbours, our masts
  decked with Jolly Rogers and our sailors convulsed with hornpipe, to seek
  the enemy. But, alas, before the ocean spray has wetted our ruby nostrils
  we shall find ourselves descended upon from above and bombed
  promiscuously in the middle watch.</p>

  <p>It will be all over inside a nautical second. The sky will be black
  with hostile aircraft, and there will be lead in the stew and bleeding
  bodies in the bilge. Hollow laughter will sound from the bridge, where
  the Captain will find the wheel come away in his hand, and the gramophone
  will revolve eternally on a jazz rune because no one will be alive to
  stop it. When all these things occur we of the Navy will know that our
  day is past and done.</p>

  <p>Why our Mr. Spooner is such a remarkable fellow is because he can sit
  deep in an easy-chair and recite these things without turning a single
  hair on his top lip. Of course he realises that the work of the Navy must
  go on&mdash;until the crash descends. But it is rather unsettling for us.
  It seems to give us all a sort of impermanent feeling. Quite naturally we
  all ask what is the use of keeping up the log and painting the ship? Why
  isn't all the spare energy in the ship bent to polishing up our
  boat-drill? or why aren't the people who can afford it encouraged to buy
  unsinkable waistcoats? The Admiralty must know all about it if they are
  still on speaking terms with the Air Ministry. It's a beastly
  feeling.</p>

  <p>Yesterday a formation of powerful aeroplanes, which Spooner called the
  "Clutching Hand," came out from the land and flew round us, and simply
  prodded us with their propellers as we lay defenceless on the water.</p>

  <p>The bogey is undoubtedly spreading. The Admiral came aboard this
  afternoon to inspect our new guns. He yawned the whole time in his beard
  and did not ask a single question. We suppose he realises that the whole
  business is merely a makeshift arrangement for the time being and not
  worth bothering about as long as the brass is polished and the guns move
  up and down easily.</p>

  <p>Well, as far as we are concerned it only remains for Number One, who
  has a brother in the Air Force, to cancel his winter order with Breezes,
  the naval tailors, and we shall all go below and pack our trunks and get
  ready to hand the ship over to Spooner. If the Navy of the future must be
  under water there is no particular reason why we should be there too.</p>

<h2>THE CONSPIRATORS.</h2>

<p class="center">1.</p>

  <p>My Dear Charles,&mdash;You continue to ask me what I am doing, and
  why, and when I am going to sign the Peace, like everyone else, and
  return to honest work. The answer is in the negative. Though I am very
  fond of peace, I don't like work. And, as for being honest, I tend rather
  to politics. Have I never told you that I take a leading part on the
  Continent in the great Class War now raging? And, by the way, has anyone
  let you know that it is only a matter of time before the present order of
  society is closed down, the rule of the proletariat established and
  people like Charles set on to clean the streets or ruthlessly
  eliminated?</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Lenin</font> began to worry about you as long ago as
  1915, and you know what happens to people when <font
  class="sc">Lenin</font> really starts to worry about them. He wasn't
  satisfied that enough violent interest was being taken in you; the mere
  Socialists he regarded as far too moderate and genteel. As for their
  First and their Second International&mdash;he wanted something
  thoroughgoing, something with a bit of ginger to it. So at the Zimmerwald
  Congress on the 5th September of that year all the out-and-outs
  unanimously declared war to the knife agin the Government, whatever and
  wherever the Government might be. How many long and weary years have you
  waited, Charles, to be told what Zimmerwaldianism might be&mdash;a
  religious tendency, a political aspiration, a valvular disease of the
  appendix or something to do with motor-cars? Ah, but that is as nothing
  to the secrets I am going to let you into, to force you into, before I
  have done with you.</p>

  <p>It was not until well into 1918 that I myself began to worry about
  <font class="sc">Lenin</font>. He had left Switzerland by that time,
  having got tired of the jodelling Swiss and their infernally placid
  mountains. When the revolution broke out in Russia he felt it was just
  the thing for him, and his German backers felt he was just the man for
  it. So <font class="sc">Lenin</font>, whose real name isn't <font
  class="sc">Lenin</font>, went into partnership with <font
  class="sc">Trotsky</font>, whose real name isn't <font
  class="sc">Trotsky</font>, and set up in business in Moscow. But the
  thing was too good to be confined to Russia; an export department was
  clearly called for. It was when they began in the "off-licence" trade, in
  the "jug-and-bottle" business, that they ran up against your Henry.</p>

  <p>With the view of upheaving Switzerland, <font class="sc">Lenin</font>
  and Co. sent a Legation to its capital, the principle being, no doubt,
  that before you cut another people's throat you must first establish
  friendly relations. This Legation arrived in May, 1918, when we were all
  so occupied with the War, making returns and indents and things, that it
  hoped to pass unnoticed. But there was something about that Legation
  which caught the eye; it had not the Foreign Office look about
  it&mdash;smart Homburg hats, washleather gloves, attaché-cases with
  majestic locks, spats ... there was something missing. It looked as if it
  might be so many Anarchists plotting a bomb affair.</p>

  <p>And that's what it was. I suppose you will say I am inventing it when
  I tell you that it used to sit round a table, in the basement of an
  Italian restaurant, devising schemes for getting rid of people
  (especially people like Charles) <i>en bloc</i>; that it didn't provide
  the Italian restaurant-keeper with as much money as he thought he could
  do with; that the Italian restaurant-keeper came round to see us after
  dark; wouldn't give his name; came into the room hurriedly; locked the
  door behind him; whispered "H'st!" and told us all about it. It requires
  an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg
  249]</span> Italian to do that sort of thing properly; but this fellow
  was better than the best. I couldn't go to a cinema for months afterwards
  because it lacked the thrill of real life.</p>

  <p>We were so impressed with his performance that we asked him his trade.
  He dropped the sinister, assumed the bashful and told us that he was an
  illusionist and juggler before he took to restaurant-keeping and
  sleuthing. He juggled four empty ink-pots for our entertainment and made
  one of them disappear. Not quite the way to treat a world-revolution; but
  there! This was all in the autumn of 1918, when we were naturally a bit
  above ourselves.</p>

  <p>Switzerland has four frontiers&mdash;German, Austrian, Italian and
  French. Lenin's Legation had opened up modestly and without ostentation
  as becomes a world's reformer, a distributing office on each one of the
  four. Somehow I could never work myself up to be really alarmed at jolly
  <font class="sc">Anna Balabanoff</font>, but I fancy she has done as much
  harm since as most people achieve here on earth. Her job was to work into
  Italy; but in those days, when war conditions still prevailed, she
  couldn't do much more than stand on the shores of the Lake of Lugano and
  scowl at the opposite side, which is Italian. Do you remember the lady's
  photograph in our daily Press? If so you will agree with me that even
  that measure was enough to start unrest in Italy....</p>

  <p>Charles, my lad, let us break off there and leave you for a week all
  of a tremble. In the course of these Sensational Revelations we are going
  to see something of the arrangements made for the break-up of the old
  world, which, with all its faults, we know we still love. The process of
  reconstruction is not yet defined, and will probably not be attempted in
  our time. In any case, when things arrive at that stage, there will be no
  Charles and, I am still more sorry to say, no Henry.</p>

  <p>Now, whatever you may think about it, I for one am not prepared to be
  scrapped and to become part of a dump of oddments waiting instructions
  for removal from a Bolshevist Disposals Board. You know what these
  Disposal Boards are; one's body might lie out in the rain for years while
  the minutes were being passed round the Moscow Departments. I have
  worried myself to death about it, and now I am going to worry you. I am
  going to make your flesh creep and your blood run cold. No use your
  telling me you don't care what is coming along in the future, provided
  you can be left in peace for the present. <i>I shall tap you on the
  shoulder and shall whisper into your ear the resolutions passed with
  regard to you as recently as the end of July last at Moscow.</i>. I'll
  make you so nervous that you daren't get into bed, and, once in bed,
  daren't get out again. I expect to have you mad in about three weeks, and
  even then I shall pass more copies of this paper, with more revelations
  in them, through the bars of your asylum window.</p>

  <p>All that for sixpence a week is not expensive, is it, dear
  Charles?</p>

<h3>TO JAMES IN THE BATH.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Without the bolted door at muse I stand,</p>
      <p>My restive sponge and towel in my hand.</p>
      <p>Thus to await you, Jimmy, is not strange,</p>
      <p>But as I wait I mark a woeful change.</p>
      <p>Time was when wrathfully I should have heard</p>
      <p>Loud jubilation mock my hope deferred;</p>
      <p>For who, first in the bathroom, fit and young,</p>
      <p>Would, as he washed, refrain from giving tongue,</p>
      <p>Nor chant his challenge from the soapy deep,</p>
      <p>Inspired by triumph and renewed by sleep?</p>
      <p>Then how is this? Here have I waited long,</p>
      <p>Yet heard no crash of surf, no snatch of song.</p>
      <p>James, I am sad, forgetting to be cold;</p>
      <p>Does this decorum mean that we grow old?</p>
      <p>I knew you, James, as clamorous in your bath</p>
      <p>As porpoises that thresh the ocean-path;</p>
      <p>Oh! as you bathed when we were happy boys,</p>
      <p>You drowned the taps with inharmonious noise;</p>
      <p>Above the turmoil of the lathered wave</p>
      <p>How you would bellow ditties of the brave!</p>
      <p>How, wilder that the sea-mew, through the foam</p>
      <p>Whistle shrill strains that agonised your home.</p>
      <p>In the brimmed bath you revelled; all the floor</p>
      <p>Was swamped with spindrift; underneath the door</p>
      <p>The maddened water gushed, while strong and high</p>
      <p>Your piercing top-note staggered passers-by.</p>
      <p>But now I hear the running taps alone,</p>
      <p>A faint and melancholy monotone;</p>
      <p>Or just a gentle swirl when sober hope</p>
      <p>Searches the bath's profound to salve the soap.</p>

<h3>IN A GOOD CAUSE.</h3>

  <p>Among the minor charitable organisations of London not the least
  admirable and useful is the Santa Claus Home at Highgate, which the two
  Misses <font class="sc">Charles</font> have been administering with such
  devotion and success since 1891. Its modest aim is to keep open twenty
  beds for small children suffering from hip and spinal disease, and to
  give them such treatment as will prevent them becoming hopeless cripples;
  and this purpose hitherto has been fulfilled no one can say exactly how,
  but with help not only from known friends but mysteriously from the
  ravens. To-day, however, the high cost of living has set up a very
  serious obstacle, and debt and failure seem inevitable unless five
  hundred pounds can be collected quickly. Any reader of <i>Punch</i> moved
  to bestow alms on as sincere and deserving a a work of altruism as could
  be found is urged to send a donation to Miss <font
  class="sc">Charles</font>, Santa Claus Home, Cholmeley Park, Highgate,
  N.6.</p>

<h3>THE SHRIMP TEST.</h3>

  <p>At last we have an explanation of a good deal of the social and
  industrial unrest of recent months. Since April there has been a serious
  shrimp shortage.</p>

  <p>How far this is responsible for dissatisfaction among the miners and
  other workers it is impossible to say; but in other circles of society
  this shrimp shortage has been responsible for much. From golf-courses
  this summer has come a stream of complaint that the game is not what it
  was. Sportsmen, again, have gone listlessly to their task and have
  petulantly wondered why the bags have been so poor. House-parties have
  been failures. In many a Grand Stand nerves have gone to pieces.
  Undoubtedly this grave news from the North Sea is the explanation. What
  can one expect when there are no shrimps for tea?</p>

  <p>For the eating of shrimps is more than a mere assimilation of
  nourishment, more even than the consumption of an article of diet which
  is beneficial to brain tissues and nerve centres. After all, the oyster
  or the haddock serves equally well for those purposes.</p>

  <p>But before one eats a shrimp a certain deftness and delicacy of
  manipulation are needed to effect the neat extraction of the creature
  from its unpalatable cuticle. Not so with the haddock.</p>

  <p>Shrimp-eating is something more than table deportment; it is a test of
  <i>sangfroid</i> and <i>savoir faire</i>, qualities so necessary to the
  welfare of the nation. The man who can efficiently prepare shrimps for
  seemly consumption, chatting brightly the while with his fair neighbour
  and showing neither mental nor physical distress, can be relied upon to
  comport himself with efficiency whether in commerce or statecraft.</p>

  <p>Watch a man swallow an oyster, and how much more do you know of him
  after the operation than you knew before? But put him in a Marchioness's
  drawing-room and set a shrimp before him, and the manner in which he
  tackles the task will reveal the sort of stuff he is made of.</p>

  <p>The shrimp test is one before which physically strong men have broken
  down, while the seemingly weak have displayed amazing fortitude.</p>

  <p>In these days, when it behoves every man among us to be at his best,
  we view this famine in shrimps with grave concern, and we trust that the
  Board of Agriculture and Fisheries is alive to the significance of this
  crisis.</p>

<h3>MIRIAM'S TWO BABIES.</h3>

  <p>That last morning at Easthaven, Miriam, alone of us three, preserved
  her equanimity. I had arisen with the lark, having my own things to pack,
  to say nothing&mdash;though nothing was not the only thing I
  said&mdash;of Billie's pram and Billie's cot and Billie's bath. I wished
  afterwards I had let the lark rise by himself; if I do heavy work before
  breakfast I always feel a little depressed ("snappy" is Miriam's crude
  synonym) for the remainder of the day.</p>

  <p>As to Billie, his first farewells went off admirably. He blew a kiss
  to the lighthouse, that tall friend who had winked at him so jovially
  night after night. And it was good to see him hoisted
  aloft&mdash;pale-blue jersey, goldilocks and small wild-rose
  face&mdash;to hug his favourite fisherman, Mr. Moy, of the grizzled beard
  and the twinkling eyes.</p>

  <p>But when the time came for Billie to say good-bye to the beach he
  refused point-blank.</p>

  <p>"Billie wants to keep it," he vociferated.</p>

  <p>Miriam, woman-like, was all for compromise. Billie should fill his
  pail with pretty pebbles and take them to London in the puffer-train. I
  demurred. The fishermen already complained that the south-easterly gales
  were scouring their beach away. Moreover, as I explained to Miriam, ere
  long it would devolve upon me to carry the dressing-case, Billie himself
  and&mdash;as likely as not&mdash;the deck-chairs and the tea-basket. Why
  increase my burdens by a hundredweight or so of Easthaven beach?</p>

  <p>It ended by her admitting I was perfectly right, and&mdash;by Billie
  filling his pail with pretty pebbles.</p>

  <p>I still had that feeling of depression when we returned to our rooms
  for an early luncheon (there's nothing I so detest); after which we
  discovered that Miriam thought I had told the man to call for the luggage
  at 12.45, while I thought that Miriam had told the man to call for the
  luggage at 12.45.</p>

  <p>And then we had to change twice, and the trains were crowded, and
  Miriam insisted on looking at <i>The Daily Dressmaker</i>, and Billie
  insisted on not looking at <i>Mother Goose</i>.</p>

  <p>At Liverpool Street station I kept my temper in an iron control while
  pointing out to quite a number of taxi-men the ease with which Billie's
  pram and Billie's cot and Billie's bath could be balanced upon their
  vehicles. But the climax came when, Miriam having softened the heart of
  one of them, we were held up in a block at Oxford Circus, and Billie,
  <i>à propos</i> of nothing, drooped his under lip and broke into a
  roar&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Billie wants the sea-side! Billie wants Mr. Moy!"</p>

  <p>I suppose Miriam did her best, but he was not to be quieted, and old
  ladies in omnibuses peered reproaches at me, the cruel, cruel parent. I
  frowned upon Miriam.</p>

  <p>"Will nothing stop the child?"</p>

  <p>"There's a smut on your nose, dear," was all she replied. I rubbed my
  nose; I also ground my teeth....</p>

  <p>I was still wrestling on the pavement with the pram, the cot and the
  rest of it, when Billie's cries from within the house suddenly ceased.
  Had the poor little chap burst something? I hurried indoors and found
  him&mdash;all sunshine after showers&mdash;seated on the floor with
  rocking-horse and Noah's ark and butcher's shop grouped around him.</p>

  <p>"He's quite good now he's got his <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span> toys," he assured me, no
  doubt echoing something Miriam had just said.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I reached my study and collapsed into a chair. What a day! But little
  by little, shelf upon shelf, I became aware of the books I had not seen
  for a whole month: <font class="sc">Lamb</font>, my Elizabethans, a row
  of <font class="sc">Stevenson</font>. I did not want to read; it was
  enough to feast one's eyes on their backs, to take down a volume and
  handle it my old green-jacketed <font class="sc">Browning</font>, for
  instance. And the small red <font class="sc">Merediths</font> all needed
  rearranging.</p>

  <p>A little later I turned round to see Miriam standing in the doorway.
  Remorse seized me; I put an arm about her, with&mdash;"Tired, old
  thing?"</p>

  <p>She looked down at my books and, half-smiling, she looked up
  again.</p>

  <p>"He's quite good now he's got his toys," she said, and kissed me.</p>

<h3>VERY PERSONAL.</h3>

  <p>Just to see what it looks like with my name in it, I have been making
  a diary of my doings (some real, some imaginary) in the approved language
  of the Society and Personal column.</p>

  <p>I am Mr. James Milfly. This is how it looks:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yesterday was the fortieth birthday of Mr. James Milfly. He passed it
  quietly at the office and at home. No congratulatory messages were
  received and no replies will be sent."</p>

  <p>"Among the outgoing passengers on the paddle steamer <i>Solent
  Tortoise</i>, on Tuesday, was Mr. James Milfly. He returned to the
  mainland the same evening, and will be at Southsea four days longer,
  after which, unless he can think of an adequate excuse, he will return to
  town."</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Milfly, who recently sustained a laceration of the finger
  while cleaning his safety razor after use, passed another good night. The
  injured member is healing satisfactorily, and no further bulletins will
  be issued."</p>

  <p>"The performance of <i>The Bibulous Butler</i> at the Corinthian
  Theatre last night was witnessed by Mr. James Milfly and party, who
  occupied two seats in the eighth row of the pit."</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Milfly is a guest for the week-end at Acacia Lodge,
  Clumpton, the residence of his old friend, Mr. Albert Purges. Excellent
  sparrow-shooting was enjoyed after tea on Saturday in the famous home
  coverts from which the lodge derives its title."</p>

  <p>"Among those unable to be present at the Duchess of Dibdale's
  reception on Friday was Mr. James Milfly, no invitation having reached
  him."</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Milfly has been granted his wife's authority to wear on his
  watch-chain the bronze medal of the Blimpham Horticultural Society, won
  by his exhibit of a very large marrow at the society's recent show."</p>

  <p>"Maria, Mrs. Murdon, is visiting her son-in-law, Mr. James Milfly. Her
  stay is likely to be a lengthy one."</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Milfly will spend the greater part of to-morrow in London.
  No letters will be forwarded."</p>

  <p>Try this for yourself. You have no idea what a sense of pomp and
  well-fed importance it gives you.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"A Night Out."</p>

  <p>Everybody except myself seems to recall the fact that the late farce
  of this name, adapted from <i>L'Hôtel du Libre Echange</i>, ran for five
  hundred nights before it expired. Some restorative music has now been
  applied to it and the corpse has revived. Indeed there are the usual
  signs of another long run. The trouble is that nearly all the cast at the
  Winter Garden Theatre seem to think that, if the play is to run, they
  must run too. They don't keep still for a moment, because they dare not.
  Even Mr. <font class="sc">Leslie Henson</font>, whose fun would be more
  effective if he didn't try so hard, feels that he must be at top pressure
  all the while with his face and his body and his words. Yet he could well
  afford to keep some of his strength in reserve, for he is a born
  humourist (in what one might perhaps call the Golliwog vein). But,
  whether it is that he underrates his own powers or that he can't contain
  himself, he keeps nothing in reserve; and the others, less gifted, follow
  his lead. They persist in "pressing," as if they had no confidence in
  their audience or their various authors or even themselves.</p>

  <p>One is, of course, used to this with singers in musical comedy, who
  make a point of turning the lyrics assigned to them into unintelligible
  patter. Perhaps in the present case we lost little by that, though there
  was one song (of which I actually heard the words) that seemed to me to
  contain the elements of a sound and consoling philosophy. It ran
  something like this:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For you won't be here and I won't be here</p>
      <p class="i2">When a hundred years are gone,</p>
      <p>But somebody else will be well in the cart*</p>
      <p class="i2">And the world will still go on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">* Or, alternatively, soup.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Leslie Henson</font>, as I have hinted, allowed
  himself&mdash;and us&mdash;no rest. His energy was devastating; he gave
  the audience so much for their money that in the retrospect I feel
  ashamed of not having paid for my seat. One's taste for him may need
  acquiring; but, once acquired, there is clearly no getting away from it.
  Perhaps his most irresistible moment was when he laid out six policemen
  and then meekly surrendered to a female constable who led him off by the
  ear.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Fred Leslie</font> (a name to conjure with!) was
  almost fiercely emphatic in the part of <i>Paillard</i>, and I preferred
  the relatively quiet methods of Mr. <font class="sc">Austin
  Melford</font>, who did without italics. Mr. <font class="sc">Ralph
  Roberts</font> was droll as a waiter; and it may have been my fault that
  I found Mr. <font class="sc">Davy Burnaby</font> rather unfunny in the
  part of <i>Matthieu</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the ladies, two could sing and two, or even three, could act (Miss
  <font class="sc">Lily St. John</font> could do both); nearly all had good
  looks and a few of them were pleasantly acrobatic.</p>

  <p>The scene of the Hotel Pimlico, with an alleged private sitting-room
  on one side, an alleged bedroom on the other, and a hall and staircase in
  the middle, was extraordinarily unconvincing. The partition walls came to
  an end at quite a long distance from the front; and, with the general
  company spreading themselves at large over the whole width of the
  foreground, it was very difficult to entertain any illusion of that
  privacy which is of the essence of the <i>cabinet particulier</i>. I say
  nothing of the bedroom, whose tenancy was frankly promiscuous.</p>

  <p>The fun, of course, is old-fashioned; if one may say it of a French
  farce, it is Victorian. Apart from a few topical allusions worked in
  rather perfunctorily there is scarcely anything said or done that might
  not have been said or done in the 'eighties. But for a certain type of
  Englishman there is a perennial attraction in feeling that at any moment
  the proprieties may be outraged. That they never actually are outraged
  does not seem very greatly to affect his pleasure. He can always console
  himself with easy conjecture of the wickedness of the original. So there
  will never be wanting a public for these <i>Noctes Parisianæ</i>.</p>

  <p>Let us hope that somehow it all helps to keep the sacred flame of the
  Entente burning. <i>Vive <font class="sc">Millerand</font>!</i></p>

<h2>BETTERING THE BANYOROS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Student of Anthropology.</i>)</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">James Frazer's</font> luminous <i>résumé</i> of
  the investigations of the <font class="sc">Mackie</font> Expedition
  amongst the Banyoros has only one defect. He omits all reference to the
  subsequent and even more fruitful visit of the Expedition to the
  adjoining Noxas tribe, whose manners and customs are of extraordinary
  interest. This remarkable race are noted not merely for their addiction
  to the dance, but for the kaleidoscopic rapidity with which the dances
  themselves are changed from season to season. Only a few years ago the
  entire tribe were under the spell of the Ognat, which in turn gave place
  to the Tortskof and the Zaj, the last named being an exercise in which
  violent contortions of the body were combined with the profoundest
  melancholy of facial expression. Curiously enough the musicians who are
  employed at these dances are not of indigenous stock, but of a negroid
  type and are imported from a distance at high salaries.</p>

  <p>The literary gifts of this singular tribe are on a par with their
  saltatory talent, but are at present mainly occupied in the keeping of
  personal records, led therein by a chieftainess named Togram, in which
  the conversations, peculiarities, complexions and dresses of their
  friends are set down and described with ferocious <i>bonhomie</i>. The
  tablets containing these records are then posted up in conspicuous places
  of resort, with the most stimulating and entertaining results.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that the ruler of the country is not chosen from the
  dancing or Bunihugoro section of the community, but from the powerful
  Renim clan, who devote themselves intermittently to the task of providing
  the country with fuel. The chieftain wields great power and is regarded
  with reverence by his followers, but is in turn expected to devote
  himself entirely to their interests, and if he fails to satisfy is
  promptly replaced by a more energetic leader. As the great bulk of the
  community yield allegiance to an hereditary sovereign of strictly defined
  powers this interesting country offers the agreeable spectacle of a state
  in which the dulness of constitutional government is happily tempered by
  the delights of industrial dictatorship.</p>

<h2>PIGS.</h2>

  <p>"Pigs pays," said Mrs. Pugsley.</p>

  <p>"So I have heard."</p>

  <p>"Pigs always pays; but Pugsley's pigs pays prodigious."</p>

  <p>I rejoiced with her.</p>

  <p>"Took 'em up sudden, he did; and now that interested! You'd never
  think that pigs 'ld twine themselves round a man's heart, so to speak,
  would you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"That's how it is with Willum. Reads nothing but about pigs; they'm
  his only joy. In partnership with Uncle Eli over them. First time Uncle
  Eli took to anything wholesome in his life. When Willum loses a pig he's
  that low that he puts on a black tie. Wonnerful!"</p>

  <p>It was. I knew Willum, otherwise Uncle Billy, and something about his
  tastes. I had the pleasure of meeting him on the foreshore that
  afternoon. No doubt he was studying pigs; but the title of the book he
  had in his hand was <i>Form at a Glance</i>.</p>

  <p>"Pig form, I presume," said I politely.</p>

  <p>"Now then, Missie, don't go giving me away. All's lovely at home. Me
  and Uncle Eli has clubbed together to buy Bodger's racing tips. Bodger's
  got brain. Doing very well, we are. Sure, I can't tell the missus, and
  she a Plymouth Rock."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it Plymouth Sister?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe; but I think there's a rock in it somewhere. Anyway we agreed
  when we married to keep our purses in the same drawer, and mine's
  bulging."</p>

  <p>"You are a brave man, Uncle Billy. What about the day she will want to
  see your pigs?"</p>

  <p>"A thought that wakes me at night. We keep 'em out in the country, I'd
  have you know. There, why take a fence before you come to it? There'll be
  wisdom given."</p>

  <p>Apparently there was, but the address from which the wisdom came was
  indistinct.</p>

  <p>"Willum," said Mrs. Pugsley one day, "to-morrow I'm coming to see they
  pigs of yours; bless their fat sides!"</p>

  <p>"You shall, my tender dear," said Uncle Billy. "Yes, to-morrow noon
  you'll see the blessed things."</p>

  <p>Almost at dawn he presented himself at Farmer Dodge's and astonished
  that good man by asking to be allowed to hire a few pigs for the day.</p>

  <p>Farmer Dodge scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've been asked to loan out most things in my time, but never
  pigs before. Where be taking them?"</p>

  <p>"Home."</p>

  <p>"That's a matter of better than two miles. Have 'ee thought of the
  wear and tear and the loss of good lard? No, Uncle Billy, I won't fly
  against the will of Heaven. If pigs had been meant to go for walks they'd
  have had legs according. Their legs hain't for walking; they'm for
  hams."</p>

  <p>Uncle Billy drew near and explained. Farmer Dodge grinned.</p>

  <p>"To do down your missus? Well, I like a jest as well as any, and to
  put females in their place is meat and taties to me; but 'tis a luxury,
  and luxury is what you like but can do without."</p>

  <p>In the end Uncle Billy drove a bargain by which he secured the use of
  six pigs for a few hours and paid three shillings per pig. For
  three-and-six he also hired the help of a boy to drive them; as he
  remarked, he could have had more than another pig for that money, but it
  would be warm work for him alone.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the houses on the terrace of the little sea-side
  town where the Pugsleys lived were thrilled at noon by the arrival of a
  small herd of swine. The animals looked rather tired but settled down
  contentedly in the front-garden of No. 3.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pugsley, hearing their voices, came to the door.</p>

  <p>"Why, Willum, I was just making ready to come out with you to go and
  see them."</p>

  <p>"My tender dear," he said with emotion, "would I let you be taken
  miles in this heat to see the finest pigs ever littered? No. 'Tis not for
  my wife to go to see pigs, 'tis for pigs to come to see my wife. Here
  they be. That's Spion Kop, the big black one&mdash;called because 'tis
  the highest mountain in America and he's to make the highest price. The
  pink one is Square Measure, for he'll eat his own size in meal any day.
  That's Diadem&mdash;no, it's not; Diadem lost&mdash;I should say Diadem's
  lost to us." Uncle Billy lifted his hat reverently. "The ginger one is
  Comrade&mdash;a fine name."</p>

  <p>"Why, 'tis a little sow."</p>

  <p>"And what better comrade than a blessed female, my loving dear, and
  who'd know that better than me?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you go mixing me up with the pigs, Willum; I won't have it.
  What's the name of that perky black one?"</p>

  <p>"Mount Royal," said Uncle Billy. "I'm a <font class="sc">King's</font>
  man and like to respect they set over me. Royal just means one of the
  <font class="sc">King's</font> family."</p>

  <p>The parade was dismissed; the herd returned to its home and Uncle
  Billy paid the cost of wear and tear.</p>

  <p>He sat smoking that evening in a state of blissful content. All had
  gone well; the dreaded black moment was over. Mrs. Pugsley knitted
  furiously in silence.</p>

  <p>"Now what might you be turning over in that mind of yours?" asked
  Uncle Billy.</p>

  <p>"Pigs."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't do better."</p>

  <p>"And their names. Maybe you won't christen any more until after the
  Cesarewitch."</p>

  <p>She folded up her knitting and went to bed, leaving Uncle Billy as if
  turned to stone. When he recovered he sought out Uncle Eli and
  said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Eli, she's known all along. She knowed when I was driving they
  brasted pigs here in the heat. She's never been took in at all. And
  that's a woman. That's what married me."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

  <p>Undeniably ours is an age in which fond memory fills not only the
  heart of man but the shelves of the circulating libraries to a degree
  bordering upon excess. But, let reminiscences be even more frequent than
  they are, there would yet remain a welcome for such a book as Mr. W.H.
  <font class="sc">Mallock's</font> attractive <i>Memoirs of Life and
  Literature</i> (<font class="sc">Chapman and Hall</font>). The reason of
  this lies not more in the interest of what is told than in the fact that
  these memories have the advantage of being recalled by one who is master
  of a singularly engaging pen. Nothing in the book better displays its
  quality of charm than the opening chapters, with their picture of an
  old-world Devonshire, and in particular the group of related houses in
  which the boyhood of the future anti-socialist was so delightfully spent.
  Gracious homes have always had a special appeal to the author of <i>The
  New Republic</i>, as you are here reminded in a score of happy
  recollections. Then comes Oxford, and that meeting with <font
  class="sc">Swinburne</font> in the Balliol drawing-room that seems to
  have been the common experience of memoir-writers. Some entertaining
  chapters give a cheerful picture of London life when Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mallock</font> entered it, and Society, still Polite, opened
  its most exclusive doors to the young explorer. The rest of the book is
  devoted to a record of friendships, travel, an analysis of the writer's
  literary activities, and a host of good stories. Perhaps I have just
  space for one quotation&mdash;the prayer delivered by the local minister
  in the hall of Ardverike: "God bless Sir John; God bless also her dear
  Leddyship; bless the tender youth of the two young leddies likewise. We
  also unite in begging Thee to have mercy on the puir governess." A book
  of singular fragrance and individuality.</p>

  <p>The Victorians used to talk, perhaps do still, about the lure of the
  stage; but I am inclined to suppose this was as nothing beside the lure
  of the stage-novel. All our writers apparently feel it, and in most cases
  their bones whiten the fields of failure. But amongst those of whom this
  certainly cannot be said is Mr. <font class="sc">Horace A.
  Vachell</font>, whose new book, <i>The Fourth Dimension</i> (<font
  class="sc">Murray</font>), has both pleased and astonished me by its
  freedom from those defects that so often ruin the theatrical story. For
  one thing, of course, the explanation of this lies in my sustaining
  confidence that I was being handed out the genuine stuff. When a
  dramatist of Mr. <font class="sc">Vachell's</font> experience says that
  stage-life is thus and thus, well, I have to believe him. As a fact I
  seldom read so convincing a word-picture of that removed and esoteric
  existence. The title (not too happy) means the world beyond the theatre,
  that which so many players count well lost for the compensations of
  applause and fame; and the story is of a young and phenomenally
  successful actress, <i>Jess Yeo</i>, in whom the claims of domesticity
  and the love of her dramatist husband are shown in conflict with the
  attractions of West-End stardom and photographs in the illustrated
  papers. Eventually&mdash;but I suppose I can hardly tell that without
  spoiling for you what goes before the event. Anyhow, if I admit that the
  ending did not inspire me with any sanguine hope of happiness ever after,
  it at least put a pleasant finish on an attractive and successful
  tale.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>In the Mountains</i> (<font class="sc">Macmillan</font>) is one of
  those pleasant books of which the best review would be a long string of
  quotations, and that is a very complimentary thing to say about any
  novel. Written in diary form, on the whole successfully, it tells little
  of doing and much of being, and a great deal more of feeling than of
  either. It is scarcely <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"
  id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> necessary after that to add that it is
  discursive. As a matter of fact I found that for me that half of its
  charm which did not lie in being whisked off, as it were by magic, to sit
  in the sunshine of Switzerland lay in its author's reflections upon
  subjects quite unconnected with her story, and as far apart from each
  other as <font class="sc">Law's</font> <i>Serious Call</i> and the effect
  of different kinds of underclothing on the outward demeanour of the
  wearer. From the human document point of view it is as a picture of the
  convalescence of a soul sick with grief that <i>In the Mountains</i>
  deserves attention. I cannot imagine that anyone who has ever got well
  again after sorrow will fail to recognise its truth. The little mystery
  and the slender love-story which hold the discursiveness together are
  just sufficient but so slight that they shall not even be hinted at here.
  For the rest the book is whimsical, thoughtful, sentimental by turns and,
  in spite of its tolerance, a shade superior; with now and then a phrase
  which left me wondering whether a blushing cheek would deserve the Garter
  motto's rebuke; in fact it resembles more than anything else on earth
  what the "German garden" of a certain "Elizabeth" might grow into if she
  transplanted it to a Swiss mountain-top.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Peregrine in Love</i> (<font class="sc">Hodder and
  Stoughton</font>) is a story whose sentimental title does it considerably
  less than justice. It gives no indication of what is really an admirably
  vivacious comedy of courtship and intrigue, with a colonial setting that
  is engagingly novel. Miss <font class="sc">C. Fox Smith</font> seems to
  know Victoria and the island of Vancouver with the intimacy of long
  affection; her pen-pictures and her idiom are both of them convincingly
  genuine. The result for the reader is a twofold interest, half in seeing
  what will be to most an unfamiliar place under expert guidance, half in
  the briskly moving intrigue supposed to be going on there. I say
  "supposed," because, to be frank, Miss <font class="sc">Fox
  Smith's</font> story, good fun as it is, hardly convinces like her
  setting. You may, for example, feel that you have met before in fiction
  the lonely hero who rescues the solitary maiden, his shipmate, from
  undesirable society, and falls in love with her, only to learn that she
  is voyaging to meet her betrothed. At this point I suppose most
  novel-readers would have given fairly long odds against the betrothed in
  question keeping the appointment, and I may add that they would have won
  their money. Not that <i>Peregrine</i> was going to find the course of
  his love run smooth in spite of this; being a hero and a gentleman he had
  for one thing to try, and keep on trying, to bring the affianced pair
  together, and thus provide the tale with another than its clearly
  predestined end. Of course he doesn't succeed, but the attempt furnishes
  capital entertainment for everybody concerned, and proves that Mr.
  Punch's "C.F.S." can write prose too.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The title of <i>Gold Must be Tried by Fire</i> (<font
  class="sc">Macmillan</font>) might be called axiomatic for the precise
  type of fiction represented by the story. Because, if gold hadn't to be
  tried by fire, you might obviously marry the hero and heroine on the
  first page and save everybody much trouble and expense. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Richard Aumerle Maher</font>, however, knows his job better
  than that. True, he marries his heroine early, but to the wrong man, the
  Labour leader and crook, <i>Will Lewis</i>, who vanishes just before the
  entrance of the strong but unsilent hero, only to reappear (under an
  alias) in time to get shot in a strike riot. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Maher's</font> book comes, as you may already have guessed,
  from that great country where they have replaced alcohol by sugar, and
  where (perhaps in consequence) heroines of such super-sentimentality as
  <i>Daidie Grattan</i> have no terrors for them. Personally I found her
  and her exploits on burning ships, besieged mills and the like a trifle
  sticky. For the rest you have some interesting details of the workings of
  the paper industry; a style that to the unfamiliar eye is at times
  startling (as when, on page 282, the hero's head "snapped erect"); and
  lots and lots of love. As for the ending, to relieve any apprehensions on
  your part, let me quote it. "Taking her swiftly in his arms, he
  questioned: 'Has the gold come free from the fire at last, my darling?'
  'Gold or dross,' she whispered as she yielded, 'it is your own.'"
  <i>Ah!</i></p>

<hr />

  <p><i>Love's Triumph</i> (<font class="sc">Methuen</font>) is concerned
  to a great extent with the development of a raw Kentucky lad into an
  attractive and resourceful man; but its chief interest lies rather with
  his trainer. When <i>Victor McCalloway</i> arrived in Kentucky and took
  <i>Boone Wellver</i> under his wing it became obvious enough that he was
  bent on reconstructing his own life as well as moulding <i>Boone's</i>.
  <i>McCalloway</i>, when the seal of his past is broken, turns out to be
  <i>Sir Hector Dinwiddie, D.S.O., K.C.B.</i>, a tradesman's son who was
  generally believed to have killed himself in Paris. I must assume that
  Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Neville Buck</font> intended us to recognise
  in <i>Sir Hector</i> a certain General whose name acquired a painful
  notoriety not so long ago. The reader may form what opinion he likes of
  the good taste of all this, but there can be no question that the author
  has drawn a fine character. At the outset his style is so jumpy that the
  story is difficult to follow, but presently its course grows clearer and
  I fancy that you will follow it keenly, as I did, to the end.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
